# Air-ticket-booking-system
这是一个机票订票系统，是我C++面向对象的程序设计课程的大作业;
虽然完成了，但仍然存在一些严重问题（如程序初始页面输入4退出时，会报错，同学说是string的问题）;
但我学的还太少难以找出bug的出处，如果有大佬看到，并且有兴趣的话，可以帮忙指出，谢谢！
This is a flight booking system, is my C++ object-oriented programming course of the big assignment;
Although it is finished, there are still some serious problems 
(for example, when the initial page of the program enters 4 and exits, an error will be reported）.
However, I have learned too little to find out the source of the bug. 
#If any of you are interested in it, you can point it out. Thank you!
